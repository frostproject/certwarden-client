## Client
Cert Warden Client is a lightweight client that automatically fetches 
certificates from Cert Warden and runs an http server to receive 
further updates directly from the Cert Warden Server.

Cert Warden Client is also able to restart docker containers to make 
them pick up new certificate files, when they're written.
