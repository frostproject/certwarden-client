## Client
LeGo CertHub Client is a lightweight client that automatically fetches 
certificates from LeGo CertHub and runs an http server to receive 
further updates directly from the LeGo Server.

LeGo CertHub Client is also able to restart docker containers to make 
them pick up new certificate files, when they're written.
